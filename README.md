# Quick_ISO_Extraction


## The main purpose of this is, when downloading all your ISO zipped files (legally), you may encounter some problems when extracting them into your hardive. This is a very simple script that extracts all the ISO files (only) and copies them into a single location. If the files are corrupted or incorrect it deletes the extracted files and flags for a re-download.
